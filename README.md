# Proteosim_EA

## ***What does this project do?***

runs experimental simulation of proteomic data

### ***simulation***
#### *digestion*
Proteins are digested by a selected enzyme
**Output:**
Peptide sequences
#### *MS1:*
mass spectrometry with all peptide sequences (double charge)<br>
**Output:**
spectrum of all peptide sequences
##### *MS2:*
fragmentation of one single peptide sequence (b- and y-ions)
mass spectrometry with one peptide sequence (single charge)<br>
**Output:**
spectrum of one peptide sequence

## ***How to use this package***
# Project Overview

## Installation

To install the package and its dependencies, follow these steps: <br>

pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install .

This ensures all external dependencies are installed first, followed by the package itself using the configuration specified in `pyproject.toml`.

You can find the example notebook at `ms_experiment_final.ipynb` in the repository root.
