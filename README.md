# Proteosim_EA

## ***What does this Project do?***

runs experimental simulation of proteomic data

### ***simulation***
#### *digestion*
Proteins are digested by a selected enzyme
**Output:**
Peptide sequences
#### *MS1:*
mass spectrometry with all peptide sequences (double charge)
**Output:**
spectrum of all peptide sequences
##### *MS2:*
fragmentation of one single peptide sequence (b- and y-ions)
mass spectrometry with one peptide sequence (single charge)
**Output:**
spectrum of one peptide sequence
